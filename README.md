# Hi, I'm Nick 👋

I'm a Linux-focused technologist transitioning into systems administration and cybersecurity, with particular interest in infrastructure automation and operational technology (OT/ICS) environments. My background in trade work and emergency services shapes how I think about reliability, safety, and real-world systems.

---

## Current Focus
- Linux system administration and containerized services (Docker)
- Networking fundamentals and segmentation
- Automation with Bash and systemd
- OT/ICS security concepts and lab environments

---

## Selected Projects

### 🔧 Containerized Bedrock Server
**[`containerized-bedrock-server`](https://github.com/desvert/containerized-bedrock-server)**  
Production-style Minecraft Bedrock server deployment using Docker Compose. Features persistent storage, automated backups, gamerule enforcement, and resilient restart behavior.

*Focus: Linux administration, container lifecycle management, automation*

---

## Home Lab & Learning
Multi-VM home lab using Vagrant and Docker for Linux, networking, and security practice. Ongoing coursework in networking and cloud fundamentals, with self-directed projects bridging IT and OT concepts.

**Technical Blog:** https://desvert.github.io

---

## Approach
I build small, well-documented systems that recover cleanly from failure, automate repetitive tasks, and prioritize maintainability. Repositories here are intentionally minimal and documented to reflect operational thinking.

---

## Tools & Technologies
Linux (Ubuntu, Rocky) • Docker/Compose • Bash • systemd • Git • Networking (TCP/IP, DNS, routing) • OT/ICS protocols

**Note:** This GitHub serves as a working portfolio and learning log with a focus on documentation and operational mindset.
