# Hi, I'm Nick 👋

I'm Linux-focused and working toward roles in systems administration and cybersecurity, especially in infrastructure automation and OT/ICS environments. Coming from trade work and emergency services, I tend to think in terms of reliability, safety, and systems that need to function under real-world conditions.

---

## Current Focus
- Linux system administration and containerized services (Docker)
- Networking fundamentals and segmentation
- Automation with Bash and systemd
- OT/ICS security concepts and lab environments

---

## Selected Projects

### 🔧 Containerized Bedrock Server
**[`containerized-bedrock-server`](https://github.com/desvert/containerized-bedrock-server)**  
Production-style Minecraft Bedrock server deployment using Docker Compose. Features persistent storage, automated backups, gamerule enforcement, and resilient restart behavior.

*Focus: Linux administration, container lifecycle management, automation*

### 🌡️ OT HVAC Testbed

**[`ot-hvac-testbed`](https://github.com/desvert/ot-hvac-testbed)**
Microcontroller-driven HVAC control and instrumentation testbed used to explore real-world operational technology concepts. The project incorporates sensor telemetry, actuator control, serial data logging, and basic control logic across multiple platforms, with an emphasis on observability, safety, and failure-aware design.

*Focus: OT/ICS fundamentals, embedded systems, Linux-based data logging, system reliability*

## Home Lab & Learning
Multi-VM home lab using Vagrant and Docker for Linux, networking, and security practice. Ongoing coursework in networking and cloud fundamentals, with self-directed projects bridging IT and OT concepts.

**Technical Blog:** https://desvert.github.io

---

## Approach
I build small, well-documented systems that recover cleanly from failure, automate repetitive tasks, and prioritize maintainability. Repositories here are intentionally minimal and documented to reflect operational thinking.

---

## Tools & Technologies
Linux (Ubuntu, Rocky) • Docker/Compose • Bash • systemd • Git • Networking (TCP/IP, DNS, routing) • OT/ICS protocols

**Note:** This GitHub serves as a working portfolio and learning log with a focus on documentation and operational mindset.
