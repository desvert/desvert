# Hi, I’m Nick 👋

I’m a Linux-focused technologist transitioning into systems administration and cybersecurity, with a particular interest in infrastructure, automation, and operational technology (OT / ICS) environments.

My background spans hands-on trade work, emergency services, and IT coursework, which has shaped how I think about reliability, safety, and real-world systems. I’m especially interested in how traditional infrastructure intersects with modern automation and security practices.

---

## Current Focus
- Linux system administration and troubleshooting
- Containerized services (Docker, Compose)
- Networking fundamentals and segmentation
- Automation with Bash, cron, and systemd
- OT / ICS security concepts and lab environments

---

## Selected Projects

### 🔧 Containerized Bedrock Server
**[`containerized-bedrock-server`](https://github.com/desvert/containerized-bedrock-server)**  
A production-style deployment of a Minecraft Bedrock Dedicated Server on Ubuntu using Docker Compose. Includes persistent storage, graceful live backups, automated gamerule enforcement, and resilient restart behavior.

Focus areas: Linux administration, container lifecycle management, automation, and configuration drift mitigation.

---

## Home Lab & Learning
- Multi-VM home lab for Linux, networking, and security practice
- Vagrant- and Docker-based environments
- Ongoing coursework in networking and cloud fundamentals
- Self-directed projects bridging IT and OT concepts

---

## How I Approach Projects
I prefer small, well-documented systems that:
- recover cleanly from failure
- automate repetitive tasks
- make configuration and intent explicit
- prioritize maintainability over cleverness

Most repositories here are intentionally minimal and documented to reflect how I work in real environments.

---

## Technical Writing

I maintain a technical blog where I document hands-on projects, lab work, and lessons learned while studying Linux, networking, and security concepts.

## Tools & Technologies
- Linux (Ubuntu, Rocky)
- Docker / Docker Compose
- Bash scripting
- systemd, cron
- Git & GitHub
- Networking fundamentals (TCP/IP, DNS, routing)
- Introductory OT / ICS protocols and concepts

---

## Notes
This GitHub is used as a working portfolio and learning log.  
Documentation-heavy repositories are intentional and reflect an operational mindset rather than a focus on application development.
